## üß† Project Overview

**K(no)wMatch** is a powerful de-anonymization framework developed to **reconstruct hidden identities** from a **protected dataset**.

We leverage a suite of **advanced matching algorithms**, **feature weighting strategies**, and **ensemble techniques** to maximize decoding accuracy ‚Äî carefully matching encrypted profiles to their original counterparts.

## üî• Techniques Implemented

| Process | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **1Ô∏è‚É£ Cosine Similarity Matching** | Finding nearest neighbors using cosine similarity on normalized features. |
| **2Ô∏è‚É£ Batch-Based Matching (Memory Efficient)** | PCA-driven dimensionality reduction with batched Euclidean matching. |
| **3Ô∏è‚É£ Direct Euclidean Distance Matching** | Matching based purely on minimal Euclidean distance between feature vectors. |
| **4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature-Weighted Matching** | Customized weighting of features based on domain knowledge importance. |
| **5Ô∏è‚É£ Hybrid Top-3 Candidate Decoding** | Combining weighted and non-weighted scores for ultimate decoding accuracy. |

## ‚ö° Final Solution Strategy

‚úÖ Apply **Process 4** and **Process 5** separately on the protected data.  
‚úÖ Merge the outputs containing **matching score** and **weighted matching score**.  
‚úÖ Compute a **Final Hybrid Score**:
```
Final Score = 0.3 √ó Matching Score + 0.7 √ó Weighted Matching Score
```
‚úÖ Select best match based on the **lowest Final Score**.  
‚úÖ Implement **Top-3 Decoding** for validation and improved recall.

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Result |
|:-------|:-------|
| Top-1 Accuracy | **92.1%** |
| Top-3 Recall | **98.5%** |
| Average Final Score | **0.243** |
| Score Standard Deviation | **0.065** |

**Note:**  
Higher weights on **critical fields** like `Income`, `Occupation`, and `Loan Repayment` significantly boosted reconstruction success rates.

## üöÄ**Why Our Solution is the Best**

Our solution doesn‚Äôt rely on just one attack technique.
Instead, it creates an intelligent hybrid approach by:
	‚Ä¢	Combining unweighted and weighted distance metrics,
	‚Ä¢	Carefully tuning feature importances using domain knowledge,
	‚Ä¢	Using Top-3 decoding to ensure maximum recall,
	‚Ä¢	Designing a scalable memory-efficient pipeline.

This multi-layered defense-breaking method helped us achieve over 92% Top-1 Accuracy with a clean, auditable, and reproducible codebase.

## üèÅ **Conclusion**

Data protection is only as strong as its weakest anonymization layer.
With K(no)wMatch, we demonstrate that even moderately obfuscated datasets can be reverse-engineered using advanced matching techniques.
